What is this?

This is a 2D game where its sole objective is to mine all the "Unobtanium" minerals
scattered within the world. 
The only units capable of mining resources are the "engineers" and the materials 
they accumulate can be used to make different units. 

This game is made from using a Java library called "Slick2D".

I used the object-orientated programming paradigm to construct this game, including
the use of inheritance (abstract type "unit" -> "Engineer" type) and encapsulation
(i.e. returning only copy of values of certain objects). However, although I 
included the OOP paradigm, there is lack of design patterns present.
